# nmap flags and options
-sT 				Perform a full open TCP scan 
-sS 				Perform a SYN (stealth) TCP scan 
-sU 				Perform a UDP scan 
-sR or -sV 			Perform an RPC service scan (should be used in conjunction with another scan type) 
-A 					aggressive scan for more info
-O 					Try remote OS detection 
-O --osscan-guess 	guess the OS if not detected
-P0 				Don√≠t try to see if a host is up before scanning it 
-p 					<port range> Specify a range of ports to scan 
-M 					<max connections> The maximum number of parallel connection attempts to make at one time. For LANs, should be no more than 18. For slow links (WAN, Internet), this can be significantly higher.
